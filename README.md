## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOM Manipulation
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This challenge was a great refresher for me on DOM manipulation. In the past year, I have only been coding with react, so I have forgotten the basics of manipulating the DOM. I definitely enjoyed coding this challenge and I'm looking forward to the next one.

I have also learned how to use the psudo class, focus. While it was fun relearning DOM manipulation again, I struggled to figure out how to change the number rating buttons' styles after clicking and removing that styling after a sibling element was clicked in JavaScript. I then eventually learned that I can just use the focus pseudo class.

```
.btn:focus {
    background-color: hsl(217, 12%, 63%);
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I learned a lot in this challenge but what I am looking forward to the most is feedback that I will receive on frontendmentor. I am sure that there is a better way in solving this project out there and I can't wait to find out if I did alright, specially in my choice to just hide the ratings-container after hitting submit. :see_no_evil:


### Useful resources
